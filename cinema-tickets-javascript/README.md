# cinema-tickets-javascript

I used npm as my package manager. Use `npm ci` to install the dependencies as I've used them.

I've used jsDoc with Typescript to add some type-checking to the development workflow but I've left the code in Javascript as requested. I added types to the 'third-party' modules but did not touch any of their code. Use `npm run check` to run the type checks.

I've used the coverage report in jest to ensure all the obvious error cases and happy paths are covered by tests. Use `npm test -- --coverage` to run the tests and see the coverage report.
